     <h4>What it Takes</h4>
     <br>
     <a>My mind is racing, heart is pacing<br>
        Everything I want I taste it<br>
        I embrace it Gotta have the patience,<br>
        edication Never leave a moment wasted,<br>
        chasing greatness I think its<br>
        kinda funny that they slept on me<br>
        Here's a couple things<br>
        they should know about me No plan B<br>
        just a one way ticket This is what it takes<br>
        that's the difference I been waiting for this all my life,<br>
        it's my time I never hesitate, I dig down,<br>
        stand my ground Look at all the valleys that<br>
        I made it through You're looking at somebody<br>
        with too much to lose The sacrifices made everyday,<br>
        it's the price I pay This is what it takes <br>
        Eyes on the prize yeah this is what it takes<br>
        (This is what it takes) Eyes on the prize<br>
        when it's make or break (This is what it takes)<br>
        Eyes on the prize yeah this is what it takes,<br>
        this is what it takes The way I play <br>
        it's calculated Gonna take the game and change it,<br>
        fuck the haters Turn the blood, 'n sweat, <br>
        'n tears to gold When you break the mold and get results,<br>
        here we go I been waiting for this all my life,<br>
        it's my time I never hesitate, I dig down, <br>
        stand my ground Look at all the valleys that I made it through <br>
        You're looking at somebody with too much to lose<br>
        The sacrifices made everyday,<br>
        it's the price I pay This is what it takes Eyes<br>
        on the prize yeah this is what it takes (This is what it takes)<br>
        Eyes on the prize when it's make or break (This is what it takes)<br>
        Eyes on the prize yeah this is what it takes, <br>
        this is what it takes What's it gonna be Eyes <br>
        on the prize yeah this is what it takes Eyes on the prize<br>
        when it's make or break Eyes on the prize yeah this is what it takes,<br>
        this is what it takes What's it gonna be <br>
        I been waiting for this all my life, it's my time I never hesitate,<br>
        I dig down, stand my ground Look at all the valleys that<br>
        I made it through You're looking at somebody with too much to lose<br>
        The sacrifices made everyday, it's the price <br>
        I pay This is what it takes Eyes on the prize<br>
        yeah this is what it takes (This is what it takes)<br>
        Eyes on the prize when it's make or break (This is what it takes)<br>
        Eyes on the prize yeah this is what it takes, <br>
